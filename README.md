This was for an IEEE credit hours (Des!gn News CEC)
I do these classes because I can obtain IEEE professional credit hours, and I enjoy the company of the engineers who participate.
This was for a class where we used the ESP-8266 or Arduin0 Huzz@h board using Lua. So we did some walk through of Lua.
